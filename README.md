## Description

The purpose in creating this application was to allow for users to be able to create/edit/delete thoughts, create/delete friends, and create/delete reactions to other people's thoughts.
This project uses mongoDB and the npm packages mongoose/express to run and keep track of users and their friends/thoughts/reactions.

If a user is to be deleted, all of the thoughts they have posted get deleted along with it!

To see the api in action, please check out my video guide [here]().
